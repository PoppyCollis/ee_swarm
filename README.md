Embodied evolutionary (EE) algorithm for open-ended continuous adaptation of swarm robotics.

This uses the 'SituSim' (SITuated and embodied robotics SIMulator) written in Python (Dept. Eng. & Inf., University of Sussex).

The key files written by myself are <strong>HungryRobot_probabilistic2.py</strong> (found in situsim extensions folder) and <strong>MyForager.py</strong> (found in lab 5 folder).

All plots are also contained in the folder <strong>lab 5</strong>.

<em>In the natural world, the evolutionary process provides organisms with adaptive capabilities in a
completely decentralised and distributed manner; one in which the evaluation of genes is an implicit
and embodied process directly affected by agents’ behaviour. This is in contrast to the majority of
artificial evolutionary algorithms developed for the purpose of automated design and optimisation
which rely on centralised mechanisms of control.</em>

<em>In this paper, we present an embodied evolutionary
(EE) algorithm as a mechanism for the adaptive control of swarm robotics. Inspired by previous work
by Watson et al. (2002), EE is presented as a cheap and effective method by which adaptation in a
collective robotic system can be decentralised and autonomous, with candidate solutions evaluated in
parallel. We take the work of Watson et al. (2002) further by testing the limits of the system’s adaptive
abilities and viewing its performance through the lens of W. Ross Ashby’s early work on ultrastable
systems, and exploring the potential for open-ended continuous adaptation.</em>

<em>We find that our system
can adapt to a range of environmental conditions and is moderately successful in its ability to adapt to
large-scale perturbations. Our analyses provide us with preliminary insight into which parameters of
the algorithm which determine its success and have pointed us towards opportunities for future
research in this area.</em>
